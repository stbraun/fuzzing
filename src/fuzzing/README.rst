basepkg: modules not specific for a certain application.
==================================================================


This project provides simple generally applicable functions and classes for Python programs.

Currently it helps with:

  * Declaration of a class as singleton simply using the ``@singleton`` decorator.
  * Random testing of functions and applications.
  * Logging configuration.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install most Python packages is via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

    $ pip install basepkg
